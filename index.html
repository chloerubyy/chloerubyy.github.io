            <p>My dad's homemade lasagna! It takes him a couple of days to make, and he only does it twice a year. It is always a treat!</p>

            <h2>Modern Slang I Wish Would Go Away</h2>
            <p><strong>Slang:</strong> 67</p>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> I honestly couldn't even tell you what it means. It is kind of like how the meme for the number 21 came about. I guess a Junior in college is the age you stop thinking these brain-rot jokes are entertaining.</p>
            <p><strong>Why I Don't Like It:</strong> It is simply taking over and genuinely not funny, nor does it make sense. You can't have the number 67 anywhere without the younger generation commenting on it. </p>

            <p><strong>Why I Liked It:</strong> As someone studying graphic design, I am not only worried but intrigued by the possibilities of AI. So, reading this article that goes over the impacts and complications of AI on my field of study feels personal and beneficial.</p>
